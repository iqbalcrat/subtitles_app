00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,120
Hi, everybody, the United Kingdom was once the symbol of power and heritage because of

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,640
their 200 years of looting colonies like India.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:18,959
The West in its predatory form came into India in the mid 18th century.

4
00:00:18,959 --> 00:00:23,639
But in spite of all the treasure hunting, now, the UK is going through the worst economic

5
00:00:23,639 --> 00:00:26,120
and social crisis in its history.

6
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:32,480
As of 2024, while the debt level of Germany stands at 63.74% of its GDP, Ireland stands

7
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:42,639
at 42.5%, India stands at 58.2%, whereas, the UK debt stands at 99.5% of their GDP.

8
00:00:42,639 --> 00:00:46,040
And you know what's even more worrying, while in other countries, the workforce is getting

9
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:51,480
bigger and bigger in the UK, people are leaving the workforce due to long term sickness.

10
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,560
At the same time, UK's productivity has remained stagnant since 2008 crisis, the hospitals

11
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:01,419
are falling short of nurses, and 45% of the patients have been waiting in an emergency

12
00:01:01,419 --> 00:01:03,840
for four long hours.

13
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,720
And today, there is such a big labor shortage, that UK has a shortage of more than 100,000

14
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,120
truck drivers.

15
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,680
And all of this put together, UK is seeing the sharpest increase in absolute poverty

16
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:40,839
in 30 long years.

17
00:01:40,839 --> 00:01:45,360
So the question is, how did UK's economy fall into such a terrible situation?

18
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,279
What are the biggest mistakes that UK made, which caused this massive economic crisis?

19
00:01:50,279 --> 00:02:10,679
And lastly, what are the lessons that India needs to learn from the fall of UK's economy?

20
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:21,720

24
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,000
People India's education system is so messed up that even after studying for four years,

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,880
35% of our engineers and 30% of our MBA grads are unemployable.

26

46
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,360
And now on with the episode.

47
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,160
This is a story that dates back to 2016.

48
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,960
And this is when UK decided to exit the European Union.

49
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:17,200
So on 23rd of June 2016, in a special election called the referendum, the people of United

50
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,000
Kingdom voted to leave the European Union by a 50 to 48 vote share.

51
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,160
And this is where the chaos in the economy started with something called Brexit.

52
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,760
The UK has voted to leave the European Union.

53
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,119
We got our country back.

54
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,880
The vote leave side presented a very optimistic view of what the British economy would look

55
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,440
like after Brexit.

56
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,000
Now before we dive into Brexit, you need to understand a very, very important part of

57
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,519
history and that is the formation of European Union.

58
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:47,959
Long story short, after the World War Two ended, the leaders of European countries realized

59
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:52,000
that if they act as individual countries, and if they compete with each other or fight

60
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,859
with each other, they'll be wasting a ton of money and a ton of manpower.

61
00:04:56,859 --> 00:05:00,000
And if you look at the map of Europe, you will see why it makes sense.

62
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,160
Look at this guys.

63
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,880
The European countries are so small that if every country had to spend on military to

64
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,920
guard their borders, it would be very costly, right?

65
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,959
Similarly, if a country like Hungary wants to trade with the world, it would be a land

66
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:15,980
locked country with no access to sea at all.

67
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:20,160
So if they wanted access to the North Sea, they would have to pay taxes to Austria and

68
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,720
Germany because they would be using their land.

69
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,480
So in this futile race of defense and trade taxes, none of the countries would have progressed

70
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,040
well at all.

71
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:36,160
This is the reason why in 1952, six countries, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg,

72
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,480
and the Netherlands, they all decided to take their economic relationship to the next level

73
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,880
by forming something called the European Coal and Steel Community.

74
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,640
And this gave them some incredible advantages.

75
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:52,200
For example, when France needed lots of coal and steel, Germany offered steel and coal

76
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,880
to France to help them in post war reconstruction.

77
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,440
Similarly, Germany was able to sell its coal and steel to other members, and it was able

78
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:05,160
to make a profit with steel products to develop its economy and to decrease its debt.

79
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,359
Similarly, countries like Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg, they were able

80
00:06:09,359 --> 00:06:14,040
to get access to countries with a larger population like Germany and France.

81
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:19,399
So all of these put together, the businesses in these countries got access to six countries

82
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:21,959
with no taxes or opposition.

83
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:27,640
This is how a small union of countries benefited by sharing both resources and access.

84
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,920
And this union was so so successful, that more and more countries started to join this

85
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,920
union.

86
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:37,019
And fast forward to today, it is a union with 27 member countries.

87
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:42,640
This is how ladies and gentlemen, in 1993, this union evolved to become one of the most

88
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:47,679
powerful unions in the world, which we all know today as the European Union.

89
00:06:47,679 --> 00:06:52,359
And all these countries got three major superpowers by joining the European Union.

90
00:06:52,359 --> 00:06:56,600
Now listen to this very, very carefully, because here's where the heart of UK's economic crisis

91
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,600
lies.

92
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,200
The first superpower that these countries enjoyed was the superpower of EU citizenship,

93
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:07,600
which means all the citizens of European Union could move and reside freely in any European

94
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,679
Union country.

95
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:13,720
Secondly, in the European Union, goods, services and capital could move across national borders

96
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,600
without any barriers.

97
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,679
So a furniture businessman in Greece could sell his furniture in the UK.

98
00:07:19,679 --> 00:07:22,760
And there was no extra tax and no trade regulation.

99
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:28,959
And lastly, for the small countries, the European Union gave an unfair advantage of trade negotiation.

100
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:33,040
For example, imagine if a small country like Hungary and a giant like India sit at the

101
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,040
negotiation table.

102
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,760
Now you tell me who will have an upper hand in this negotiation.

103
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:42,920
India has a population of 1.4 billion, while Hungary's population is only 10 million.

104
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:48,000
So if we sit down for a bilateral trade agreement, we could tell Hungary that we will give your

105
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,200
automobile industry and access to a population of 1.4 billion if you reduce your import taxes

106
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,839
by 25%.

107
00:07:54,839 --> 00:08:00,119
But Hungary will have to decrease the import duty on Indian automobile by 50%.

108
00:08:00,119 --> 00:08:01,359
Why?

109
00:08:01,359 --> 00:08:05,160
Because we are a bigger country and we can exploit a small country because we are giving

110
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,760
them access to a much bigger market.

111
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,579
But you know what, guys, here's where the European Union came in.

112
00:08:10,739 --> 00:08:16,220
And they said, instead of an individual country bargaining with India, the entire European

113
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,380
Union will sit down with India to negotiate.

114
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:25,859
So now the European Union is sitting down as a single entity with a population of 447

115
00:08:25,859 --> 00:08:26,980
million people.

116
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:31,459
And this makes them so so powerful that while India has a population of 1.4 billion people

117
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:38,940
and a per capita income of $2,700, EU as an entity comes with a population of 450 million

118
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:43,659
people and a per capita income of $52,000.

119
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:48,460
So now do you realize when European Union as a giant entity sits at the negotiation

120
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:54,260
table with India, the EU has a much better bargaining power against India, even though

121
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,919
India has a population of 1.4 billion.

122
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:59,859
So this is such a fantastic arrangement, isn't it?

123
00:08:59,859 --> 00:09:04,099
Every country gets better negotiation power, better citizen freedom, better relationship

124
00:09:04,099 --> 00:09:09,580
with European powers, and most importantly, you get market access to a much wider population

125
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:12,380
as compared to your own country.

126
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:16,539
Then the question is, why did UK exit the European Union?

127
00:09:16,539 --> 00:09:21,219
Well, out of the many, many reasons, here are three of the most important reasons why

128
00:09:21,219 --> 00:09:24,299
the United Kingdom exited the European Union.

129
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:31,299
The first reason was that UK thought the European Union benefited more from UK than UK benefited

130
00:09:31,299 --> 00:09:32,700
from the European Union.

131
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:38,859
For example, between 2012 to 2016, the average volume of fish caught by the European Union

132
00:09:38,859 --> 00:09:45,539
fishermen in British waters was 760,000 tons per year, whereas the British fishermen caught

133
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:50,859
only 90,000 tons of fish in the EU waters, which was eight times less than the European

134
00:09:50,859 --> 00:09:51,859
Union.

135
00:09:51,859 --> 00:09:57,299
Similarly, in 2013, UK's gross contribution to the European Union budget was around 17

136
00:09:57,299 --> 00:10:02,820
billion euros, whereas they received back only 6.31 billion euros.

137
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:08,940
Now, if you look at the net contribution of UK, it turns out to be 10.76 billion euros,

138
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,940
right?

139
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:13,619
So if you see, there was a huge disparity in budget contributions among the European

140
00:10:13,619 --> 00:10:15,159
Union states.

141
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:20,520
So this is the reason why the Brits felt like they were being robbed by the European Union.

142
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,900
How ironical, isn't it?

143
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:25,380
For a change, the Brits felt like they were being robbed.

144
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,859
If you know what I mean, that is hilarious.

145
00:10:27,859 --> 00:10:30,559
The second thing that bothered them was immigration.

146
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:34,940
So while the European Union expanded, several countries like Poland, Czech Republic and

147
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:39,539
Hungary got in and because citizens could move across borders, many people started coming

148
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:42,659
from less developed countries into the United Kingdom.

149
00:10:42,659 --> 00:10:48,700
And foreign population almost doubled from 5.3 million in 2004 to over 9.5 million people

150
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:54,219
in 2021, which was about 12% of the entire population of UK.

151
00:10:54,219 --> 00:10:58,099
So the Brits felt worried about foreigners entering their land.

152
00:10:58,099 --> 00:11:00,500
Again, how ironical, isn't it?

153
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,539
The Brits were worried about foreigners coming into their country.

154
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:08,380
This drastically increased strain on public services and housing, lowered wages of workers

155
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:14,140
because of oversupply of labor, and eventually, it decreased job opportunities for their own

156
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,140
citizens.

157
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,619
This was the third problem that UK had.

158
00:11:17,619 --> 00:11:22,059
And lastly, the United Kingdom felt that they could easily negotiate better deals with countries

159
00:11:22,059 --> 00:11:25,940
like India, rather than the European Union doing it for them.

160
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:30,140
These are the reasons why they decided to conduct a referendum to opt out of the European

161
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,140
Union.

162
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:37,940
So after the referendum of 50 to 48, finally, Brexit happened on 23rd of June 2016.

163
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:44,020
But but but, as it turns out, as of now, things are not going well for UK at all.

164
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:59,260
And this is what the situation in UK looks like.

165
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,580
The question we heard is what on earth went wrong with Brexit?

166
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:05,059
And why is UK in such a terrible situation?

167
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:08,400
Well, the first major hit that the country faced was trade.

168
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:13,739
If you look at the stats, you will realize that European Union was one of UK's largest

169
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,460
trading partners.

170
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:23,059
As of 2022, while UK exports to EU accounted for 42% of all their exports, UK imports from

171
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:28,580
the European Union was 48% of all UK imports.

172
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:33,619
So you can imagine how much the UK depended on the European Union for trade.

173
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:37,940
But after Brexit, the UK was no longer a part of the customs union, which allowed them the

174
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:43,380
flow of goods and services among the EU countries without any import duty or customs duty.

175
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:49,539
So after Brexit, UK goods got taxed while moving to every country in the European Union.

176
00:12:49,539 --> 00:12:54,059
So to solve this problem, UK thought they could simply sign something called the free

177
00:12:54,059 --> 00:12:55,539
trade agreement.

178
00:12:55,539 --> 00:13:00,140
For those who don't know, FTA or free trade agreement is when two or more countries agree

179
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:04,020
to trade with each other with no taxes or very less taxes.

180
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:08,460
So the UK thought they could sign the free trade agreement with the European Union countries

181
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:12,780
and they could easily trade with each other without immigrants, without contribution to

182
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:17,859
the EU fund, and without allowing other European countries to exploit the UK.

183
00:13:17,859 --> 00:13:22,460
But you know what guys, here's where the UK economy faced a big big problem.

184
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:26,059
And this is a problem that even India is facing in 2024.

185
00:13:26,059 --> 00:13:28,859
So the question is, what is this problem?

186
00:13:28,859 --> 00:13:34,580
Ladies and gentlemen, this problem is that UK and India both are not manufacturing driven

187
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,780
economies, we are service driven export economies.

188
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:44,460
So we don't make most of our money by exporting products, but by exporting our services.

189
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:48,739
While the UK exports financial services, India exports IT services.

190
00:13:48,739 --> 00:13:52,700
So the question we hear is, why is a service driven economy so so dangerous?

191
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,099
And why is manufacturing better for India and UK right now?

192
00:13:56,099 --> 00:13:58,979
Well, there are three simple reasons.

193
00:13:58,979 --> 00:14:03,659
Number one, manufacturing industries can provide way more employment as compared to service

194
00:14:03,659 --> 00:14:04,659
industries.

195
00:14:04,659 --> 00:14:07,500
And this is for both skilled as well as unskilled people.

196
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:13,859
For example, while the IT industry constitutes 7.5% of our GDP, the textile industry barely

197
00:14:13,859 --> 00:14:17,260
accounts for 2.3% of our GDP.

198
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:21,419
But if you look at the employment that they provide, the numbers are staggering.

199
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:24,619
On the outset, if I asked you which sector would recruit more people, what would you

200
00:14:24,619 --> 00:14:25,619
say?

201
00:14:25,619 --> 00:14:28,059
Of course, the IT industry employs more people, right?

202
00:14:28,059 --> 00:14:32,539
Because their contribution is almost three times as much as the textile sector.

203
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:39,020
But you know what guys, while the IT services industry of India employs 5.43 million people,

204
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:42,940
our textile industry employs 45 million people.

205
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:47,539
And while the IT industry mostly recruits only skilled people, the textile industry

206
00:14:47,539 --> 00:14:52,039
employs millions of unskilled people along with the skilled people.

207
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:56,619
So the manufacturing sector provides way more employment opportunities as compared to the

208
00:14:56,619 --> 00:14:57,619
service sector.

209
00:14:57,619 --> 00:15:01,700
Secondly, while the service sector is prone to more economic shocks, the manufacturing

210
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,140
sector is relatively shockproof.

211
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:08,820
For example, during the 2008 recession, while the financial services industry and the marketing

212
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:14,020
services took a massive hit, companies like Nestle, Procter & Gamble and Unilever, they

213
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:18,099
were not as badly affected because while the people could cut down their spending on financial

214
00:15:18,099 --> 00:15:22,940
and marketing services, they could not cut down on essentials like razors, detergents

215
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,580
and baby foods.

216
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:29,919
And lastly, while manufacturing is easily scalable to increase exports, scaling a service

217
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:32,520
company is very, very difficult.

218
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:37,559
For example, if I have to increase the production of iPhones from 10,000 to 20,000 units, I

219
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:41,080
can recruit, train and deploy people within a few weeks.

220
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:46,000
And on top of that, all I have to do is get new machines and run at higher capacity.

221
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,640
But if I have to go from 20 to 30 clients in my financial services business, it is very,

222
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,900
very difficult.

223
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:56,840
And by the way, guys, unless you're an entrepreneur, you can't understand the pain of what I'm

224
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,840
saying.

225
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,840
So if you can understand this context of the pain of expansion, just talk to any service

226
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,739
industry business owner and they will tell you everything.

227
00:16:04,739 --> 00:16:09,020
So long story short, the manufacturing sector has three major advantages over the service

228
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,020
sector.

229
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:15,280
And these advantages revolve around employment, scale and resistance to economic shocks.

230
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:22,080
But now if you look at UK's economy, 81% of UK's GDP is dependent only on services.

231
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:26,320
And if you see their production, it has been stagnant for over a decade.

232
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,000
And this is the reason why ladies and gentlemen, two things happened.

233
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,520
When the service industry had to comply with 27 different countries for legal and financial

234
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:37,320
services after Brexit, the service industry of UK got disrupted.

235
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:42,320
On top of that, they saw two major crises with COVID and the Russia-Ukraine war.

236
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:48,119
It's been revealed COVID-19 has dealt the UK's economy its biggest blow in more than

237
00:16:48,119 --> 00:16:49,119
300 years.

238
00:16:49,119 --> 00:16:55,479
The Office for National Statistics has revealed the pandemic led to a 9.9% drop in the country's

239
00:16:55,479 --> 00:16:57,479
GDP over 2020.

240
00:16:57,479 --> 00:17:04,640
The actions we have taken to sanction Putin's regime are not cost free for us at home.

241
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:10,160
The invasion of Ukraine presents a risk to our recovery as it does the countries around

242
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,160
the world.

243
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:16,800
We should be in no doubt behind Putin's invasion is a dangerous calculation.

244
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:22,760
So as we all know, two economic shocks resulted into yet another disruption in both the service

245
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,219
as well as the manufacturing sector.

246
00:17:25,219 --> 00:17:31,140
This is the second reason why the UK is suffering, which is over dependence on the service industry.

247
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:37,439
And lastly, now because of Brexit, the UK is also witnessing a labor crisis.

248
00:17:37,439 --> 00:17:43,160
Long story short, as of 2021, 200,000 EU citizens have left the UK after Brexit.

249
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,619
In addition to that, the UK has a shortage of more than 100,000 truck drivers.

250
00:17:47,619 --> 00:17:53,040
And what's even worse is that there is also a shortage of 30,000 nurses in hospitals.

251
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:58,680
And in all as of 2024, there are 889,000 vacancies in the UK because of which sectors

252
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,000
like hospitality and transport are struggling.

253
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,579
So now UK is finding it extremely difficult even while the global economy is growing.

254
00:18:06,579 --> 00:18:10,300
And to make matters worse, the pound sterling is depreciating, which is further causing

255
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,239
inflation and it is making people poor.

256
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:18,199
So all of this put together, UK is now entered into a vicious cycle where the government

257
00:18:18,199 --> 00:18:22,020
is not spending on health and welfare for people, people are not able to work because

258
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,619
of long term illness.

259
00:18:23,619 --> 00:18:25,939
These people are neither earning nor spending.

260
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:28,619
So again, the economy is not growing at all.

261
00:18:28,619 --> 00:18:33,979
As a result, neither the government nor the businesses have money to expand or earn.

262
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:38,619
This is nothing but the cause and effect relationship between the government spending, public health,

263
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:41,579
workforce participation and economic growth.

264
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:46,979
This is the story of the European Union, Brexit and its impact on the UK economy.

265
00:18:46,979 --> 00:18:52,500
And this entire story teaches us three very, very important lessons for the Indian economy.

266
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,140
Lesson number one, never consult stupid people for an important decision.

267
00:18:56,140 --> 00:19:00,760
In this case, the decision of Brexit was not made by the economists of the country, but

268
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:05,099
by the people of UK who obviously did not know anything about running the economy.

269
00:19:05,099 --> 00:19:10,140
So if you ask an unemployed worker if he should ban foreign workers or not, he will obviously

270
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,619
say yes, right?

271
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:15,660
Because that would give him more demand and money even if he is incompetent.

272
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,020
But what on earth does a worker know about running a nation?

273
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:23,099
So if you consult the people of the country for a critical economic decision, it will

274
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:27,459
lead to a disaster because a mob doesn't understand economics.

275
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:30,660
Lesson number two, there are many economists out there who believe that India can grow

276
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,959
by boosting its service industry.

277
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:37,540
But while the focus on service industry is absolutely important, it is equally or perhaps

278
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:40,739
more important to grow our manufacturing sector.

279
00:19:40,739 --> 00:19:44,739
Because if we want to grow our economy and secure our people from economic shocks, it

280
00:19:44,819 --> 00:19:47,500
is easier with manufacturing than with services.

281
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:53,000
And lastly, always remember, if we want to grow our economy in the 21st century, globalization

282
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,300
for us is as important as self-reliance.

283
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,939
So we must be self-reliant.

284
00:19:57,939 --> 00:20:01,239
At the same time, we should not hesitate to trade with the world.

285
00:20:01,239 --> 00:20:04,459
Because self-reliance is not equal to isolation.

286
00:20:04,459 --> 00:20:08,859
These are the lessons that India needs to learn from the economic crisis in UK.

287
00:20:08,859 --> 00:20:12,540
And I just hope as citizens of the country, you learn something valuable from this case

288
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,540
study.
